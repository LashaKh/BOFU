# Slack Private Channel Access Guide

## Overview

Your BOFU AI Slack integration **already supports private channels correctly**. The reason you might not see private channels in your channel list is due to how Slack's API works, not an issue with your code.

## Why Private Channels Don't Appear Automatically

Slack's `conversations.list` API only returns private channels that the bot user has been **explicitly invited to**. This is a security feature by design - bots cannot automatically see private channels they haven't been given access to.

## How to Access Private Channels

### For Users:
1. **Install the BOFU AI app** in your workspace (this creates the bot user)
2. **Go to the private channel** you want the app to access
3. **Type the command**: `/invite @BOFU AI`
4. **Go back to BOFU AI settings** and refresh the channel list
5. **The private channel will now appear** in the dropdown

### For Admins:
1. **Connect your admin Slack workspace** 
2. **For each private channel** you want to assign to companies:
   - Go to the private channel in Slack
   - Type `/invite @BOFU AI`
3. **Refresh the channel list** in the admin interface
4. **The private channels will now be available** for company assignment

## Key Commands

```bash
# In any Slack channel (public or private):
/invite @BOFU AI
```

## Technical Details

- ✅ **Correct scopes**: Your app requests `groups:read` (for private channels) and `channels:read` (for public channels)
- ✅ **Proper API calls**: The code calls `conversations.list` with `types=public_channel,private_channel`
- ✅ **UI indicators**: Private channels show as "(private)" and non-member channels show as "(invite bot first)"
- ✅ **Bot tokens**: Recent updates store bot tokens separately for better permissions

## Troubleshooting

### "No channels found"
- Make sure you've invited the bot to at least one channel using `/invite @BOFU AI`
- Use the "Refresh channels" button after inviting the bot

### "Channel shows (invite bot first)"
- This means the bot can see the channel exists but hasn't been invited
- Go to that channel in Slack and type `/invite @BOFU AI`

### Private channel missing from list
- The bot hasn't been invited to that private channel yet
- Private channels require manual bot invitation for security reasons

## Code Implementation

The implementation is correct according to Slack API best practices:

```typescript
// Already correctly implemented in your codebase:
const scopes = [
  'chat:write',      // Send messages
  'channels:read',   // Read public channels  
  'groups:read',     // Read private channels (this is the key scope)
  'users:read',      // Read user info
  'users:read.email' // Read user emails
];
```

## Next Steps

No code changes are required. The "missing" private channels are simply channels the bot hasn't been invited to yet, which is expected Slack behavior.

1. Invite the bot to any private channels you want to use
2. Use the refresh functionality in the improved UI
3. Enjoy seamless private channel notifications!
