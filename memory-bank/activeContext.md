**MAJOR FEATURE IMPLEMENTED**: Real-Time Mention Notifications System

**Problem Solved**: Users and admins needed to receive immediate notifications when mentioned in comments, with separate notification centers for admin dashboard and user dashboard.

**Complete Implementation**:

### 🔔 **Real-Time Mention Notification System** 
1. **Database Foundation**: Leveraged existing `comment_mentions` table with proper RLS policies
2. **Real-Time Subscriptions**: Implemented Supabase real-time subscriptions for instant notifications
3. **Dual Interface Support**: Separate notification systems for admin vs user dashboards
4. **Admin Filtering**: Sub-admins only see mentions for their assigned clients
5. **Live Count Updates**: Notification badges update in real-time without page refresh
6. **User Experience**: Toast notifications + optional sound alerts for new mentions

### 🐛 **CURRENT DEBUGGING PHASE**:

**Issue**: User mentioned "lashay" admin but notification doesn't appear in admin dashboard

**Root Cause Found**: The `createMentionNotifications` function was using incorrect user lookup logic
- **OLD**: Searched `profiles` table with `email.ilike.%${username}%` 
- **NEW**: Uses `getMentionableUsers()` RPC and matches exact `mention_text` field

**Debugging Tools Added**:
- ✅ **Enhanced `createMentionNotifications`**: Now uses proper mentionable users lookup
- ✅ **Debug function `debugMentionSystem()`**: Tests mention extraction and validation
- ✅ **Admin Debug Button**: Purple "🐛 Debug Mentions" button in admin notification center
- ✅ **Comprehensive logging**: Added detailed console logs throughout mention process

**Next Steps**:
1. User clicks "🐛 Debug Mentions" button to see available mentionable users
2. Verify what mention text should be used for "lashay" admin
3. Test creating comment with correct mention format
4. Confirm real-time notification appears in admin dashboard

### **Technical Fixes Applied**:
```typescript
// BEFORE: Incorrect lookup in profiles table
const { data: mentionedUsers } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('id, email, name')
  .or(`email.ilike.%${username}%,name.ilike.%${username}%`)

// AFTER: Proper lookup using mentionable users RPC  
const mentionableUsers = await getMentionableUsers();
const mentionedUser = mentionableUsers.find(u => 
  u.mention_text === mentionText || u.mention_text === mentionText.replace('@', '')
);
```

### **Real-Time Infrastructure**:
- **Unique Channels**: Fixed subscription conflicts with timestamp-based channel names
- **Proper Cleanup**: Subscription cleanup on component unmount prevents memory leaks  
- **Cross-Component Sync**: Header notification counts, dashboard centers, and toast notifications all sync
- **Admin Role Support**: Different subscription handling for super_admin vs sub_admin
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when subscriptions fail

### **User Interface Features**:
- **📱 Admin Notification Center**: Shows mentions with full comment context and user info
- **🔔 User Notification Center**: Real-time mention notifications with toast alerts
- **📊 Live Badge Counts**: Header notification badges update instantly
- **🎵 Audio Alerts**: Optional sound notifications for new mentions
- **📋 Batch Operations**: Mark multiple mentions as read, bulk actions
- **🔍 Filtering**: Filter mentions by read/unread status, type, etc.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/commentApi.ts`: Enhanced mention processing and real-time subscriptions
- `src/components/admin/AssignmentNotificationCenter.tsx`: Admin mention notifications + debug
- `src/components/user-dashboard/NotificationCenter.tsx`: User mention notifications  
- `src/components/MainHeader.tsx`: Real-time notification count updates
- `src/hooks/useUnreadNotificationCount.ts`: Admin notification count with mentions

**Ready for Testing**: The system is now ready for comprehensive testing with the debug tools in place.
