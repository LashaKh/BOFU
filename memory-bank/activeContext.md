## Current Work Focus
**COMPLETED: Content Brief Title Display Standardization** ✅

Successfully standardized content brief title display across both admin and user dashboards to show only clean keywords without "- Content Brief [ID]" suffix.

### Issue Analysis & Resolution:

#### **Content Brief Title Display Inconsistency** ✅ FIXED
**Root Cause**: User dashboard was still showing old format with "- Content Brief d0dfa753" suffix
- **Problem**: User dashboard (`ApprovedContent.tsx`) was generating titles as `${cleanKeyword} - Content Brief ${briefShortId}`
- **Impact**: Inconsistent title display between admin dashboard (clean) and user dashboard (with suffix)
- **Solution**: Updated all title generation logic in ApprovedContent.tsx to return clean keywords only
  - Removed briefShortId generation and concatenation
  - Applied consistent keyword cleaning logic (remove quotes, URLs, underscores)
  - Updated all four title generation paths: keywords array, JSON string keywords, SEO strategy, approved product data
  - Now matches admin dashboard clean title format

### Technical Implementation:
**Files Updated**: 
- `src/pages/ApprovedContent.tsx`: Removed "- Content Brief [ID]" suffix from all title generation paths
  - Lines 89-95: Keywords array extraction (clean keyword only)
  - Lines 97-105: JSON string keywords (clean keyword only)  
  - Lines 107-113: SEO strategy primary keyword (clean keyword only)
  - Lines 142-147: Approved product keywords (clean keyword only)

**Consistency Achieved**: Both admin and user dashboards now display identical clean titles:
- "Blackhawk Network Alternatives" instead of "Blackhawk Network Alternatives - Content Brief d0dfa753"
- Consistent keyword extraction and cleaning logic across all interfaces
- Enhanced user experience with cleaner, more readable titles

### Current Status: ✅ COMPLETE - TITLE DISPLAY STANDARDIZED
Content brief titles now display consistently across all interfaces with clean keyword extraction.

## Next Steps
