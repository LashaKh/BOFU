## Current Work Focus
**COMPLETED: Content Brief Title Display - COMPREHENSIVE FIX** ✅

Successfully fixed the content brief title display issue at its root source and cleaned up all existing data to ensure consistent clean titles across the entire application.

### Issue Analysis & Complete Resolution:

#### **Root Cause Identified & Fixed** ✅ 
**Source**: `generateUniqueTitle()` function in `src/lib/contentBriefs.ts` was creating titles with ID suffixes
- **Problem**: Function was generating titles like:
  - `${keywords[0]} Analysis - Brief ${shortId}` (Line 150-152)
  - `${data.product_name} - Content Brief` (Line 155-156)  
  - `Content Brief ${shortId} - ${briefDate}` (Line 159-160)
- **Impact**: New content briefs were being created with suffixes stored in database
- **Solution**: Updated function to generate clean titles with proper keyword extraction:
  - Extract first keyword and clean formatting (remove quotes, URLs, underscores)
  - Use product name as-is without "Content Brief" suffix
  - Fallback to "Content Brief - [Date]" without ID

#### **Database Cleanup Completed** ✅
**Existing Data**: 3 content briefs had old format titles in database
- **Before**: 
  - "benepass alternatives - Brief 9665ff42"
  - "Automated License Plate Recognition for Police 2.0 - Content Brief dd1b8557"
  - "Forma alternatives - Content Brief 7eee12b6"
- **After**:
  - "benepass alternatives" 
  - "Automated License Plate Recognition for Police 2.0"
  - "Forma alternatives"
- **Script**: Created and ran `fix_existing_brief_titles.js` to clean up all existing titles

### Technical Implementation:
**Files Updated**: 
- `src/lib/contentBriefs.ts`: Fixed `generateUniqueTitle()` function
  - Removed brief ID suffix generation from all title paths
  - Applied consistent keyword cleaning logic
  - Fixed TypeScript linter errors (removed unnecessary destructuring)
- `fix_existing_brief_titles.js`: Database cleanup script (cleaned up 3 briefs)

**Complete Resolution**: 
- ✅ **Future briefs**: Will be created with clean titles (fixed at source)
- ✅ **Existing briefs**: All database titles cleaned to remove suffixes
- ✅ **Admin dashboard**: Now displays clean titles from database
- ✅ **User dashboard**: Already had clean title display logic
- ✅ **Consistency**: All interfaces now show identical clean titles

### Current Status: ✅ COMPLETE - COMPREHENSIVE TITLE FIX
Content brief titles are now consistently clean across all interfaces and all data sources.
