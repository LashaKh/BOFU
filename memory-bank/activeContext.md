### Admin Dashboard Enhancement Summary:
The framework selection feature is now complete with proper positioning and full dropdown visibility, providing admins with a beautiful, professional interface for content strategy selection that integrates seamlessly with the AirOps workflow.

### Current Investigation: Compt Content Brief Not Showing Keywords
**Issue:** User requested content brief generation for "Compt Employee Stipend & Reimbursement Platform" but the content brief title is still showing the product name instead of the keyword "Forma alternatives"

**Analysis Done:**
- **Root Cause Understanding:** Content briefs generated from dedicated product page (not research results flow) don't have `research_result_id` linking
- **Data Flow:** Dedicated Product Page → AirOps → Content Brief Creation (external) → Database Insert
- **Missing Link:** Content briefs need to connect back to `approved_products` table to get keywords from original product analysis

**Debugging Implementation Added:**
- **Enhanced Admin Interface:** Added comprehensive debugging to `ContentBriefManagement.tsx`
- **Specific Compt Detection:** Added targeted debugging for any content brief containing "Compt" in product_name
- **Keyword Extraction Logic:** Enhanced title generation to search `approved_products` by product_name match as fallback
- **Console Logging:** Added detailed console logs with 🔍 and 🎯 emojis for easy identification

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `src/components/admin/ContentBriefManagement.tsx` - Enhanced with debugging and improved keyword extraction logic

**Next Steps Required:**
1. **User Testing:** User needs to refresh admin page and navigate to Compt content brief
2. **Console Investigation:** Check browser console for debug messages starting with `🔍` and `🎯`
3. **Data Analysis:** Debug logs will show:
   - Whether approved product exists for "Compt"
   - What keywords are stored in the product_data
   - Why keyword-based title isn't being generated
4. **Issue Resolution:** Based on debug results, implement proper fix

### Recently Completed
**Content Brief Title Enhancement - Keyword-Based Display Implementation**
- **Issue:** Content brief titles were showing generic product names (e.g., "PlateRanger") instead of descriptive keywords from product analysis data
- **Root Cause:** Title generation was using product_name field instead of utilizing available keywords from approved product analysis
- **Solution:** 
  - **Enhanced Core Logic:** Modified `getBriefById` function in `contentBriefs.ts` to fetch and prioritize keywords from `approved_products` table
  - **Display Consistency:** Updated both `UserContentBriefs.tsx` and `ApprovedContent.tsx` to use keyword-based titles
  - **Fallback Safety:** Maintained backward compatibility with product_name fallback when keywords unavailable
- **Status:** ✅ Completed for user dashboard pages, debugging admin interface keyword issue

### Technical Context
**Content Brief Generation Flow:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Dedicated Product Page] --> B[Product Approval]
    B --> C[approved_products table]
    C --> D[AirOps Integration]
    D --> E[Content Brief Creation]
    E --> F[content_briefs table]
    F --> G[Admin Interface Display]
```

**Current Problem:** Step F → G not properly linking back to step C for keyword extraction

**Database Relationships:**
- `content_briefs.research_result_id` → `approved_products.research_result_id` (works for research flow)
- `content_briefs.product_name` → `approved_products.product_name` (needed for dedicated product flow)

### Development Environment
- **Local Server:** Running on http://localhost:5176/
- **Current Branch:** main (ahead of origin by 5 commits)
- **Last Change:** Enhanced debugging for Compt keyword investigation
- **Build Status:** ✅ Successful with debugging enhancements

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Keyword Extraction Logic:**
  - Query `approved_products` table using `research_result_id` from content brief
  - Parse `product_data` JSON field to extract keywords array
  - Generate title format: `"{keyword} - Content Brief"` using first keyword
  - Fallback to `product_name || 'Untitled Brief'` when keywords not available

- **Display Page Enhancements:**
  - Converted synchronous title mapping to async keyword fetching in both display pages
  - Added comprehensive error handling for missing product data
  - Maintained all existing functionality while enhancing title generation
  - Consistent implementation pattern across UserContentBriefs and ApprovedContent pages

- **System Integration:**
  - Utilized existing database relationships without schema changes
  - Preserved all content brief functionality with zero breaking changes

## Current Status: ✅ DROPDOWN CLIPPING ISSUE FIXED

### Latest Achievement: Advanced Dropdown Positioning Solution
**Issue:** Framework dropdown being clipped/covered by parent containers
**Solution:** Implemented intelligent positioning system using React refs and fixed positioning

**Technical Solution Implemented:**

1. **Positioning Strategy:**
   - **Old:** `absolute` positioning within parent container (got clipped)
   - **New:** `fixed` positioning with calculated coordinates 
   - **Result:** Dropdown now appears above ALL elements, unclipped

2. **Dynamic Position Calculation:**
   - **React Refs:** Uses `useRef` to get button's exact position
   - **getBoundingClientRect():** Calculates precise screen coordinates
   - **Auto-Update:** Repositions on scroll and resize events
   - **Responsive:** Maintains proper position during user interactions

3. **Enhanced Z-Index Management:**
   - **Dropdown:** `z-[99999]` (extremely high priority)
   - **Overlay:** `z-[99998]` (just below dropdown)
   - **Result:** Always appears above product cards and all other UI elements

**Code Architecture:**
```typescript
// Position calculation with scroll/resize handling
const updateDropdownPosition = () => {
  if (buttonRef.current) {
    const rect = buttonRef.current.getBoundingClientRect();
    setDropdownPosition({
      top: rect.bottom + window.scrollY + 8,
      left: rect.left + window.scrollX,
      width: rect.width
    });
  }
};

// Dynamic event listeners for responsive positioning
useEffect(() => {
  if (isOpen) {
    updateDropdownPosition();
    window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll, true);
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  }
}, [isOpen]);
```
