## Narrative

As a content manager at a growing B2B SaaS company, I start my day by opening the BOFU AI dashboard to understand the current state of our content pipeline. The dashboard immediately shows me that we have 12 content pieces in various stages of production, with 3 requiring my immediate attention for approval and 2 articles ready for final review. The visual pipeline overview helps me quickly identify a bottleneck in the brief approval stage, where 5 pieces have been waiting for over 3 days. I can see that our team is performing 15% better than last month in terms of completion time, but our approval rate has dropped slightly, indicating we may need to refine our content quality processes. The dashboard's recommendation engine suggests focusing on the highest-priority client content first and provides one-click actions to reassign overdue items to available team members. Throughout the day, I receive real-time notifications about status changes and can track our progress toward monthly content goals, enabling me to make informed decisions about resource allocation and deadline management while maintaining visibility into our overall content strategy performance.
