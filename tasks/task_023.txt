# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Performance Optimizations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize editor performance for large articles and real-time features
# Details:
Implement virtual rendering for large documents. Add lazy loading for images and embedded content. Optimize real-time update frequency and batching. Implement efficient diff calculation for version comparison. Add caching strategies for frequently accessed content. Create performance monitoring tools. Implement progressive loading for article content.

# Test Strategy:
Test with very large articles (50k+ words). Measure and compare loading times before/after optimization. Test real-time performance with multiple users. Validate memory usage during extended editing sessions. Test on lower-powered devices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Virtual Rendering for Large Documents [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize editor performance for large articles by implementing virtualization techniques that render only visible content and efficiently manage memory for the TipTap/ProseMirror editor.
### Details:
Implementation steps:

1. Analyze current document rendering approach in TipTap/ProseMirror
2. Implement a virtualization strategy using one of these approaches:
   - Add `content-visibility: auto` with appropriate `contain-intrinsic-size` values to article sections in CSS
   - For React components, integrate react-window or react-virtualized to render only visible portions
   - Create a custom virtualization layer that works with ProseMirror's document model
3. Implement document chunking for very large articles:
   - Split document model into manageable sections
   - Load/unload sections as user scrolls through content
   - Maintain editing context across chunk boundaries
4. Add memory management optimizations:
   - Clean up event listeners when components unmount
   - Implement disposal of unused resources
   - Add reference tracking for large embedded objects
5. Testing approach:
   - Create test documents of varying sizes (50KB, 500KB, 5MB)
   - Measure and compare render times, memory usage, and scroll performance
   - Test editor responsiveness during typing with large documents
   - Verify that editing features work correctly with virtualization

## 2. Optimize Asset Loading and Rendering [done]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Implement lazy loading for images and embedded content, and optimize the loading sequence of editor components to improve initial load time and responsiveness.
### Details:
Implementation steps:

1. Implement lazy loading for images and embedded content:
   - Add `loading="lazy"` attribute to image elements
   - Use Intersection Observer API to detect when embedded content enters viewport
   - Implement progressive image loading with low-quality placeholders
   - Add blur-up effect for images as they load
2. Optimize script loading for editor components:
   - Add `defer` or `async` attributes to non-critical scripts
   - Implement code splitting for TipTap extensions
   - Use dynamic imports to lazy-load features like image uploads, tables, etc.
3. Reduce bundle size:
   - Audit and remove unused TipTap extensions
   - Implement tree shaking with Webpack/Vite
   - Create custom builds of ProseMirror with only required modules
   - Minify editor-specific CSS and JS
4. Implement progressive loading for article content:
   - Load essential content first
   - Defer loading of comments, revision history, etc.
   - Add skeleton screens for content that's loading
5. Testing approach:
   - Measure Core Web Vitals before and after implementation
   - Test on various network conditions (3G, 4G, etc.)
   - Verify bundle size reduction using tools like webpack-bundle-analyzer
   - Confirm all features still work correctly after optimization

## 3. Optimize Real-Time Collaboration and Updates [done]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2
### Description: Enhance real-time collaboration performance by implementing efficient update frequency, batching, and diff calculation strategies for Supabase real-time subscriptions and ProseMirror.
### Details:
Implementation steps:

1. Optimize Supabase real-time subscriptions:
   - Implement debouncing/throttling for outgoing changes (e.g., 50-100ms)
   - Add batching for multiple rapid changes
   - Configure subscription channels to minimize unnecessary updates
2. Implement efficient diff calculation for version comparison:
   - Use ProseMirror's built-in diffing capabilities
   - Optimize for minimal operations when calculating changes
   - Add caching for recent document versions to speed up diff calculations
3. Add performance optimizations for collaborative editing:
   - Consider implementing CRDT with Yjs for more efficient collaboration
   - Optimize conflict resolution strategies
   - Add presence indicators with minimal performance impact
4. Implement caching strategies:
   - Cache frequently accessed content
   - Use IndexedDB for local document history
   - Implement optimistic updates to improve perceived performance
5. Create performance monitoring tools:
   - Add instrumentation to measure collaboration latency
   - Implement dashboard for monitoring real-time performance metrics
   - Create alerts for performance degradation
6. Testing approach:
   - Simulate multiple concurrent users editing the same document
   - Measure network traffic and update frequency
   - Test conflict resolution in various scenarios
   - Verify performance under poor network conditions
   - Ensure changes are properly synchronized across clients
