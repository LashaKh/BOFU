# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Database Schema and Version Capture System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the database schema to store article versions and create the mechanism to capture versions on article saves
### Details:
1. Create a `version_history` table with the following fields:
   - `id` (primary key)
   - `article_id` (foreign key to articles table)
   - `version_number` (integer)
   - `content` (text/json of the full article snapshot)
   - `metadata` (json field storing title, tags, etc.)
   - `created_at` (timestamp)
   - `created_by` (user_id)
   - `change_summary` (optional text field)
   - `version_tag` (optional string for milestone labeling)

2. Add a `current_version` field to the articles table to track the latest version number

3. Implement a versioning service that:
   - Creates a new version record whenever an article is saved with significant changes
   - Increments the version number sequentially
   - Stores a complete snapshot of the article content and metadata
   - Captures user information and timestamp
   - Optionally accepts a change summary from the user

4. Create a version tagging mechanism that automatically tags versions based on workflow states (e.g., 'published', 'review')

Testing approach:
- Unit test the versioning service with various article change scenarios
- Verify correct storage of article snapshots
- Test automatic version numbering
- Validate the workflow state tagging functionality

**Database Schema Implementation Details:**
- Added SQL constraints for data integrity:
  - `CHECK (version_number > 0)` on version_number
  - Foreign key constraint with `ON DELETE CASCADE` for article_id
  - B-tree index on (article_id, version_number) for efficient version history retrieval
  - JSONB indexing on metadata using GIN index for optimized metadata queries

**Database Function Implementation Notes:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_version_history(
  p_article_id UUID, 
  p_content JSONB, 
  p_metadata JSONB,
  p_change_summary TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  p_version_tag version_tag_enum DEFAULT 'manual_save'
) RETURNS UUID AS $$
DECLARE
  v_new_version_id UUID;
  v_current_version INT;
BEGIN
  -- Get current version number
  SELECT COALESCE(current_version, 0) INTO v_current_version 
  FROM content_briefs WHERE id = p_article_id;
  
  -- Increment version number
  v_current_version := v_current_version + 1;
  
  -- Insert new version record
  INSERT INTO version_history(
    article_id, version_number, content, metadata, 
    created_by, change_summary, version_tag
  ) VALUES (
    p_article_id, v_current_version, p_content, p_metadata, 
    auth.uid(), p_change_summary, p_version_tag
  ) RETURNING id INTO v_new_version_id;
  
  -- Update article's current version
  UPDATE content_briefs 
  SET current_version = v_current_version
  WHERE id = p_article_id;
  
  RETURN v_new_version_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Implemented content diffing to store only changes between versions when appropriate
- Added compression for large content fields using pg_compression extension
- Created scheduled maintenance function to clean up old auto-save versions after 30 days

**Frontend Integration Components:**
- `VersionHistoryPanel.tsx` component showing version timeline with diff visualization
- `VersionSelector.tsx` dropdown for quick version navigation
- `VersionCompare.tsx` side-by-side diff viewer for comparing any two versions
- Keyboard shortcuts for version navigation (Alt+Left/Right arrows)

**Advanced Version Tagging Features:**
- Intelligent version tagging based on content change magnitude (minor/major)
- Automatic milestone tagging for significant word count changes (>20%)
- Tag-based version retention policy (keeps all milestone versions indefinitely)

**Performance Considerations:**
- Implemented batch processing for high-frequency save operations
- Added debounce mechanism (5-second window) to prevent excessive version creation
- Created database partitioning strategy for version_history table by article_id for scaling

## 2. Implement Version Comparison and Restore Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Create backend services and APIs to compare different versions of an article and restore previous versions
### Details:
1. Implement a version comparison service that:
   - Retrieves two specified versions of an article
   - Generates a diff between the versions using the diff-match-patch library
   - Formats the diff for rendering with added/removed/unchanged content clearly marked

2. Create a version restore service that:
   - Retrieves a specified historical version
   - Creates a new version with the content from the historical version
   - Maintains the version history chain (doesn't delete intermediate versions)
   - Adds appropriate metadata indicating this is a restored version

3. Develop RESTful API endpoints for:
   - Fetching a list of available versions for an article
   - Retrieving a specific version
   - Comparing two versions and returning the diff
   - Restoring a previous version

4. Implement proper error handling and validation to ensure data integrity during comparison and restore operations

Testing approach:
- Unit test the diff generation with various content change scenarios
- Test the restore functionality to ensure it creates proper new versions
- Verify API endpoints return correct data in expected format
- Test error handling with invalid inputs

Here's the additional implementation information to enhance the subtask:

## Enhanced Technical Implementation Details

### Diff Algorithm Optimization
- Implemented memory-efficient diff algorithm with O(ND) complexity using Myers' algorithm
- Added configurable thresholds for large document handling (>100KB text)
- Implemented chunking strategy for large documents that splits content into manageable sections

### Version Data Structure
```typescript
interface VersionMetadata {
  id: string;
  articleId: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  userId: string;
  parentVersionId: string | null;
  isRestored: boolean;
  restoredFromId?: string;
  changeDescription?: string;
  size: number;
  hash: string;
}
```

### Database Considerations
- Implemented optimistic locking to prevent version conflicts during concurrent restores
- Added content hashing (SHA-256) to detect duplicate versions and prevent unnecessary storage
- Created database indices on `(articleId, createdAt)` and `(articleId, hash)` for query optimization

### API Implementation
```typescript
// Example endpoint implementation
router.get('/articles/:articleId/versions/:versionId1/compare/:versionId2', 
  authenticate, 
  async (req, res) => {
    try {
      const { articleId, versionId1, versionId2 } = req.params;
      const { diffType = 'line' } = req.query;
      
      // Authorization check
      const canAccess = await authorizationService.canAccessArticle(req.user.id, articleId);
      if (!canAccess) return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Not authorized' });
      
      const diffResult = await versionService.compareVersions(
        articleId, versionId1, versionId2, diffType
      );
      
      return res.json(diffResult);
    } catch (error) {
      logger.error('Version comparison failed', { error, ...req.params });
      return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to compare versions' });
    }
  }
);
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Implemented incremental diff storage (only storing changes between versions)
- Added LRU caching for frequent version retrievals with 10-minute TTL
- Implemented batch processing for restoring multiple versions in a single transaction

### Edge Cases Handled
- Content encoding issues (UTF-8 normalization)
- Empty version handling
- Circular restore prevention (can't restore a version that would create a circular reference)
- Graceful handling of deleted referenced versions

### Monitoring & Debugging
- Added performance metrics tracking for diff operations
- Implemented detailed logging for restore operations with before/after snapshots
- Created admin-only debug endpoint for version chain visualization
