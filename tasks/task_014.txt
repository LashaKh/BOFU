- Build article collaboration statistics (comment density, resolution rates)
- Develop real-time dashboard for comment management

3. Notification System
- Set up email notifications via SendGrid/Mailgun for comments and replies
- Create in-app notification center with unread indicators
- Implement user-configurable notification preferences
- Build @mention system with targeted notifications

# Test Strategy:
1. Core Functionality Tests:
- Test all CRUD operations with various comment types and scenarios
- Verify real-time updates across multiple sessions
- Test all filtering and search capabilities with various criteria
- Validate batch operations with multiple comments

2. Performance Tests:
- Load test search functionality with large datasets
- Measure real-time update latency under various loads
- Test pagination and infinite scrolling with large comment threads
- Benchmark database query performance

3. Integration Tests:
- Verify email notification delivery and formatting
- Test external system import/export functionality
- Validate webhook triggers and responses
- Test CDN integration for assets

4. Security and Permission Tests:
- Test permission checks with different user roles
- Validate article-specific access controls
- Test guest commenting workflows
- Verify moderation and approval processes

5. User Experience Tests:
- Measure search response times
- Test real-time collaboration scenarios
- Verify notification management workflows
- Validate analytics dashboard accuracy
