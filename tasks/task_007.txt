# Test Strategy:
Test each formatting feature individually to verify correct application and removal of styles. Validate keyboard shortcuts functionality for all formatting options. Test toolbar UI across different screen sizes to ensure responsive behavior. Verify proper rendering of all formatting types in the editor and in the published view. Test color picker functionality and color application. Verify accessibility compliance with screen readers and keyboard navigation. Test combinations of formatting options to ensure they work together correctly. Perform cross-browser testing to ensure consistent behavior.
