# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement User Presence and Avatar System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a real-time user presence system that displays active users with avatars, name labels, and status indicators. This provides the foundation for all collaboration features by establishing user identity and status within the collaborative environment.
### Details:
1. Create a user presence service using Socket.io to track active users:
   - Implement connection/disconnection handlers
   - Add periodic heartbeat mechanism (30s intervals) to detect active/idle states
   - Store user metadata (id, name, avatar URL, last active timestamp)

2. Develop UI components for the active users panel:
   - Create responsive avatar component with online status indicator
   - Add user name labels with hover tooltips showing additional user details
   - Implement smooth animations for users joining/leaving
   - Use color-coded indicators for different user states (active, idle, typing)

3. Add presence persistence across page refreshes:
   - Store session data in localStorage
   - Implement reconnection logic with graceful degradation
   - Add user preferences for visibility settings

4. Testing approach:
   - Unit test the presence service with mock socket connections
   - Test UI components in isolation with various user states
   - Perform integration tests with multiple simulated users
   - Verify performance with 10+ concurrent users

# Additional Implementation Details

## Architecture Considerations
- Implement a state machine pattern for user presence states (online → idle → offline) with configurable timeouts
- Use React Context API to provide presence information throughout the application
- Consider implementing a PresenceObserver pattern to decouple UI updates from presence events

## Technical Implementation Notes
```typescript
// Example state machine implementation for presence
type PresenceState = 'online' | 'idle' | 'typing' | 'offline';

interface PresenceTransition {
  from: PresenceState;
  to: PresenceState;
  condition: () => boolean;
  action?: () => void;
}

class UserPresenceStateMachine {
  private state: PresenceState = 'offline';
  private transitions: PresenceTransition[] = [
    // Define state transitions with conditions
  ];
  
  updateState(): void {
    // Check transitions and update state accordingly
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimizations
- Implement debouncing for presence updates (100-200ms) to reduce network traffic
- Use WebWorkers for heartbeat monitoring to avoid UI thread blocking
- Implement efficient diffing to only transmit changed presence data
- Consider using IndexedDB instead of localStorage for larger presence history

## Accessibility Enhancements
- Ensure avatar components have proper aria-labels for screen readers
- Implement keyboard navigation for the user presence panel
- Add high contrast mode support for status indicators

## Advanced Features
- Add support for custom status messages (limited to 50 chars)
- Implement "focus mode" where users can temporarily hide presence notifications
- Add presence history timeline (last seen, total active time)

## 2. Implement Cursor Sharing and Follow Mode [done]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Add real-time cursor position sharing between users with visual differentiation and implement a 'follow mode' that allows users to track another user's cursor movements and viewport position.
### Details:
1. Integrate cursor sharing using Y.js and QuillCursors:
   - Implement cursor position tracking with throttled updates (100ms)
   - Create unique color assignment system for each user
   - Add smooth cursor animation with interpolation for fluid movement
   - Implement text selection visualization for remote users

2. Develop follow mode functionality:
   - Create UI toggle for enabling/disabling follow mode
   - Implement viewport synchronization when following a user
   - Add visual indicator showing which user is being followed
   - Create mechanism to automatically disable follow mode on local user interaction

3. Optimize performance:
   - Implement cursor position compression for efficient network usage
   - Only transmit cursor updates when position changes significantly
   - Add visibility detection to pause updates for non-visible users
   - Batch cursor updates when multiple changes occur rapidly

4. Testing approach:
   - Test cursor accuracy across different screen sizes and zoom levels
   - Verify smooth cursor movement with network latency simulation
   - Test follow mode with rapid scrolling and navigation
   - Ensure performance remains stable with 5+ concurrent cursors

<info added on 2025-06-04T08:01:06.580Z>
## Implementation Approach for Cursor Sharing and Follow Mode

### Technical Architecture
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for cursor interpolation to achieve 60fps smooth animations
- Implement cursor state machine with states: `idle`, `moving`, `selecting`, `following`
- Store cursor data in Y.Map with structure: `{position: {x,y}, selection: {start,end}, viewport: {top,left,zoom}}`

### Cursor Interpolation Algorithm
```typescript
// Linear interpolation function for smooth cursor movement
function lerpCursorPosition(current: Position, target: Position, factor: number): Position {
  return {
    x: current.x + (target.x - current.x) * factor,
    y: current.y + (target.y - current.y) * factor
  };
}

// Usage in animation loop
const CURSOR_SMOOTHING_FACTOR = 0.15; // Adjust for faster/slower interpolation
let animationFrameId: number;

function animateCursors() {
  remoteCursors.forEach(cursor => {
    if (cursor.isMoving) {
      cursor.displayPosition = lerpCursorPosition(
        cursor.displayPosition, 
        cursor.targetPosition, 
        CURSOR_SMOOTHING_FACTOR
      );
    }
  });
  
  renderCursors();
  animationFrameId = requestAnimationFrame(animateCursors);
}
```

### Follow Mode Implementation Details
- Create IntersectionObserver to detect when followed user moves out of viewport
- Implement smooth scrolling with easing function when following user movements
- Add 500ms debounce to viewport syncing to prevent jarring experience during typing
- Store viewport state (scrollTop, scrollLeft, zoom) in presence data

### Network Optimization
- Implement delta compression for cursor positions (only send difference from last position)
- Use Run-Length Encoding for selection ranges to minimize payload size
- Prioritize cursor updates based on activity (more frequent updates for actively moving cursors)
- Add Bloom filter to detect and avoid duplicate cursor position broadcasts

### User Experience Enhancements
- Add subtle "focus ring" animation when a user starts typing
- Implement cursor trails with opacity gradient for rapid movements
- Add mini-avatar display next to cursor for better user identification
- Provide audio feedback option when a followed user moves to a new document section

   - Track changes at character/paragraph level with user metadata
   - Store edit history with timestamps and user information
   - Create visual highlighting system for attributed content
   - Add hover tooltips showing who made each change and when

2. Develop activity feed for recent edits:
   - Create chronological feed of document changes
   - Group related edits by user and time period
   - Add filters for viewing specific user contributions
   - Implement real-time updates as new edits occur

3. Create collaboration statistics dashboard:
   - Visualize edit frequency and distribution among users
   - Show active time periods and collaboration patterns
   - Track user-specific metrics (edits, comments, reactions)
   - Add exportable reports for team productivity analysis

4. Testing approach:
   - Verify attribution accuracy with complex edit scenarios
   - Test conflict resolution with simultaneous edits
   - Validate dashboard metrics against known edit patterns
   - Perform usability testing to ensure the UI clearly communicates attribution
