Ensure keyboard accessibility for all link management operations.\n\n<info added on 2025-06-03T10:04:59.776Z>\n## Implementation Details for Link Management System\n\n### Technical Architecture\n- **Custom Extension Pattern**: Extended TipTap's Link extension using the Extension API with custom commands and options\n- **State Management**: Implemented React context for maintaining link state across editor sessions\n- **Event Delegation**: Used bubbling for efficient link event handling without individual listeners\n\n### Component Implementation Notes\n- **LinkManagement Modal**:\n  ```tsx\n  // URL validation regex with support for international domains\n  const URL_PATTERN = /^(https?:\\/\\/)?([\\da-z\\.-]+)\\.([a-z\\.]{2,6})([\\/\\w \\.-]*)*\\/?$/i;\n  \n  // Smart protocol prefixing function\n  const ensureProtocol = (url: string): string => {\n    if (!url) return '';\n    if (/^mailto:|^tel:/i.test(url)) return url;\n    return /^https?:\\/\\//i.test(url) ? url : `https://${url}`;\n  };\n  ```\n\n- **LinkTooltip Component**:\n  ```tsx\n  // Smart positioning logic to prevent screen overflow\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (tooltipRef.current && linkRef.current) {\n      const tooltipRect = tooltipRef.current.getBoundingClientRect();\n      const linkRect = linkRef.current.getBoundingClientRect();\n      const viewportWidth = window.innerWidth;\n      \n      // Adjust position if tooltip would overflow right edge\n      if (linkRect.left + tooltipRect.width > viewportWidth - 20) {\n        setPosition({ top: linkRect.bottom + 5, right: viewportWidth - linkRect.right });\n      } else {\n        setPosition({ top: linkRect.bottom + 5, left: linkRect.left });\n      }\n    }\n  }, [visible]);\n  ```\n\n### Advanced Features Implementation\n- **Debounced URL Validation**: Implemented 300ms debounce for validation to prevent UI jank during typing\n- **Link Type Detection**:\n  ```typescript\n  const detectLinkType = (url: string): 'web' | 'email' | 'phone' | 'unknown' => {\n    if (!url) return 'unknown';\n    if (/^mailto:|@/.test(url)) return 'email';\n    if (/^tel:|^\\+?\\d{8,}$/.test(url)) return 'phone';\n    return 'web';\n  };\n  ```\n- **Clipboard Integration**: Enhanced paste handling with automatic link detection:\n  ```typescript\n  editor.on('paste', ({ clipboardData }) => {\n    const text = clipboardData?.getData('text/plain');\n    if (text && URL_PATTERN.test(text) && !editor.isActive('link')) {\n      editor.commands.setLink({ href: ensureProtocol(text) });\n      return true; // Prevent default paste\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n### Accessibility Enhancements\n- **ARIA Attributes**: Added proper aria-labels and roles:\n  ```html\n  <button \n    aria-label=\"Edit link\" \n    role=\"button\"\n    class=\"link-edit-button\"\n    onClick={handleEditClick}\n  >\n    <EditIcon />\n  </button>\n  ```\n- **Focus Management**: Implemented focus trapping in modal dialog with keyboard navigation\n- **Screen Reader Support**: Added descriptive text and announcements for link operations\n\n### Performance Optimizations\n- **Memoized Components**: Used React.memo for tooltip components to prevent unnecessary re-renders\n- **Lazy Loading**: Implemented dynamic imports for modal components to reduce initial bundle size\n- **Event Cleanup**: Proper removal of event listeners in useEffect cleanup functions\n</info added on 2025-06-03T10:04:59.776Z>",

RLS Policy Overrides\nEnhanced content_briefs table policies to allow admin access:\n- **SELECT**: `user_id = auth.uid() OR public.is_admin()`\n- **UPDATE**: Same admin override logic\n- **INSERT**: Admins can insert for any user\n- **DELETE**: Admins can delete any article\n\n#### 4. Helper Functions\n- `public.is_admin()`: Checks if user is admin via admin_profiles table\n- `public.log_admin_article_access()`: Logs admin actions with metadata\n- `public.get_admin_article_access_logs()`: Retrieves filtered audit logs\n\n#### 5. Indexes for Performance\n- admin_id, article_id, access_time, action_type indexes\n- Optimized for fast audit log queries and filtering\n\n### Security Features:\n- RLS enabled on admin_article_access table\n- Admin-only access to audit functions\n- Proper permission grants for authenticated users\n- Secure function definitions with SECURITY DEFINER\n\n### Next Steps:\n1.
