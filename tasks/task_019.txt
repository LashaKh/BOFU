   - Develop retry and synchronization mechanisms for handling temporary disconnections

3. Connect OT with the article editor:
   - Integrate OT operations with the existing editor's change events
   - Implement document state synchronization on initial load
   - Add operation history tracking for audit purposes
   - Create user attribution for changes

4. Testing approach:
   - Unit test transformation functions with various conflict scenarios
   - Integration test with simulated concurrent edits
   - Stress test with high volumes of simultaneous changes
   - Test recovery from network interruptions

Here's the additional information to enhance the subtask:

## Implementation Update: Y.js CRDT Approach

### Technology Selection
- **Replaced ShareDB with Y.js**: Implemented TipTap's official `@tiptap/extension-collaboration` with Y.js CRDTs instead of operational transformation
- **CRDT Benefits**: Uses mathematically guaranteed conflict-free replicated data types that inherently avoid conflicts rather than resolving them after they occur
- **Integration**: Y.js works natively with TipTap and provides better performance characteristics for concurrent editing

### Implementation Architecture
- **Core Service**: `CollaborativeConflictResolutionService` class in `src/lib/collaborativeConflictResolution.ts`
  - Y.js document management with integrated UndoManager
  - Operation queue with priority handling for concurrent changes
  - Metrics collection for performance monitoring (conflicts resolved, operation latency)
  - Callback system for operation lifecycle events

### Database Structure
- **Migration**: `supabase/migrations/20250103000001_collaborative_operations.sql` 
- **Storage**: `collaborative_operations` table for operation persistence and audit trail
- **Security**: Row-level security policies with appropriate admin override capabilities
- **Vector Clock**: Implemented for proper operation ordering across distributed clients

### Advanced Features
- **Offline Support**: Changes automatically sync when connection is restored
- **UndoManager Integration**: History tracking with proper multi-user undo/redo capabilities
- **Awareness Protocol**: Y.js awareness for tracking user presence and cursor positions
- **Performance Optimization**: Document state synchronization uses efficient binary encoding

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Simulation Harness**: Created test utilities to simulate concurrent editing scenarios
- **Metrics Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of conflict resolution performance
- **Stress Testing**: Verified stability with 10+ simultaneous editors making rapid changes

### Editor Integration
- **Dynamic Extension Loading**: Extensions activate based on collaboration state
- **Clean Component Lifecycle**: Proper initialization and cleanup on mount/unmount
- **Preservation**: Maintains compatibility with existing editor functionality

## 3. Implement Collaborative Cursor Sharing and Edit Notifications [done]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2
### Description: Add real-time cursor position sharing between users and implement notifications for editor events to enhance the collaborative experience.
### Details:
1. Implement cursor position sharing:
   - Extend the presence system to include cursor position data
   - Create efficient data structures for tracking and transmitting cursor positions
   - Develop UI components to display other users' cursors with color coding by user
   - Implement throttling to prevent excessive network traffic from cursor updates

## Technical Implementation Details

### Cursor Position Sharing Implementation
- Use `MutationObserver` API to track DOM changes and update cursor positions
- Implement position calculation using `Range.getBoundingClientRect()` for accurate cursor coordinates
- Store cursor data in a normalized format: `{ userId, position: {x, y}, timestamp, selectionRange: {start, end} }`
- Apply cursor throttling with `lodash.throttle` at 100ms intervals to balance responsiveness and network efficiency
- Handle edge cases like line wrapping and scrolling with `IntersectionObserver`

### Real-time Notification System Architecture
- Create a pub/sub event system using custom `NotificationHub` class
- Categorize edit events by severity: 'minor', 'moderate', 'major'
- Implement notification queue with priority handling for important events
- Use CSS transitions with `transform: translateX()` for smooth notification animations
- Store recent notifications in `localStorage` for persistence across page refreshes

### Performance Optimizations
- Batch cursor updates using `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth rendering
- Implement cursor position interpolation for smoother visual tracking
- Use Web Workers for cursor position calculations to prevent UI thread blocking
- Apply binary diff algorithm to minimize edit notification payload size
- Implement cursor culling to only render cursors within viewport

### Code Example for Cursor Position Tracking:
```typescript
const trackCursorPosition = throttle((event: MouseEvent) => {
  const selection = window.getSelection();
  if (!selection || !selection.rangeCount) return;
  
  const range = selection.getRangeAt(0);
  const rect = range.getBoundingClientRect();
  const editorRect = editorRef.current.getBoundingClientRect();
  
  const cursorData = {
    userId: currentUser.id,
    position: {
      x: rect.left - editorRect.left,
      y: rect.top - editorRect.top
    },
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    selectionRange: {
      start: getTextNodeOffset(range.startContainer, range.startOffset),
      end: getTextNodeOffset(range.endContainer, range.endOffset)
    }
  };
  
  channel.send('cursor_update', cursorData);
}, 100);
```

### Security Considerations
- Implement rate limiting for cursor updates (max 10 updates/second per user)
- Apply CSRF protection for all collaborative action endpoints
- Validate cursor positions server-side to prevent spoofing
- Encrypt sensitive parts of collaborative data in transit
