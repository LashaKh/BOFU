# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Comment Resolution Workflow
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: low
# Description: Create the workflow for resolving, reopening, and tracking comment status
# Details:
Build upon the existing comment system infrastructure to implement a comprehensive comment resolution workflow. The system already has comment API infrastructure (src/lib/commentApi.ts), database schema (article_comments table), basic CRUD operations, comment status enum ('active' | 'resolved' | 'archived'), and basic status update functions.

**Enhanced Resolution UI Components**:
- Create CommentResolutionPanel component for bulk operations
- Enhance CommentThread with resolution indicators and buttons
- Add resolution status badges and visual states
- Implement resolution confirmation dialogs

**Advanced Status Management**:
- Add status change history tracking (new table: comment_status_history)
- Implement smart resolution suggestions based on activity
- Add auto-resolution rules for inactive comments
- Create resolution templates for common scenarios

**Resolution Analytics & Reporting**:
- Build resolution rate dashboard
- Track average resolution time per user/article
- Create resolution performance metrics
- Generate weekly/monthly resolution reports

**Notification & Workflow Integration**:
- Send notifications when comments are resolved/reopened
- Email digest for unresolved comments
- Integration with admin approval workflow
- Slack/Discord webhook support for team notifications

**Advanced Filtering & Search**:
- Filter by resolution status with date ranges
- Search resolved comments by content/author
- Create "my unresolved comments" view
- Implement resolution due dates and reminders

**Batch Operations & Admin Tools**:
- Mass resolution with reason templates
- Bulk reopen with workflow triggers
- Admin override capabilities with audit trail
- Export resolved comments for documentation

# Test Strategy:
Test each phase of the implementation plan separately:

**Phase 1 (Enhanced UI Components)**:
- Verify CommentResolutionPanel renders correctly and handles bulk operations
- Test CommentThread resolution indicators and buttons for proper functionality
- Validate status badges display correctly in different states
- Test confirmation dialogs for user experience and validation

**Phase 2 (Status History Tracking)**:
- Verify history records are created for all status changes
- Test database schema and relationships for comment_status_history
- Validate API endpoints for history retrieval
- Test history display in the UI

**Phase 3 (Advanced Filtering)**:
- Test all filter combinations with various data sets
- Verify search functionality for resolved comments
- Test performance with large datasets
- Validate "my unresolved comments" view functionality

**Phase 4 (Notification System)**:
- Test notification delivery for status changes
- Verify email digest generation and formatting
- Test integration with admin approval workflow
- Validate webhook functionality for external platforms

**Phase 5 (Analytics)**:
- Test dashboard metrics calculations
- Verify report generation functionality
- Test performance metrics accuracy
- Validate data visualization components

**General Testing**:
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Performance testing with large comment volumes
- Security testing for admin operations
