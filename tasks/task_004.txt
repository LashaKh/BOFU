# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Basic TipTap Editor Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the foundation React component for the rich text editor using TipTap
# Details:
Set up TipTap v2 with React integration. Create a basic EditorComponent that initializes TipTap with essential extensions (document, paragraph, text, heading, bold, italic, etc.). Implement a simple toolbar with basic formatting options. Create editor state management with React hooks. Style the editor container with Tailwind CSS for a clean interface.

# Test Strategy:
Render the component in isolation with mock content. Test basic text input and formatting. Verify editor initialization and state management. Test component responsiveness across different screen sizes.
