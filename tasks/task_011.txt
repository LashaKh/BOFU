# Title: Implement Basic Image Editing Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Add image cropping, resizing, and basic editing capabilities
# Details:
Integrate a lightweight image editor component. Implement crop, resize, and rotate functions. Add basic filters (brightness, contrast, saturation). Create an image editing modal that appears when editing an existing image. Implement image optimization before upload (compression, format conversion). Update storage and database when images are edited. Add image alignment options (left, center, right, full width).

# Test Strategy:
Test each editing function with sample images. Verify image quality after edits. Test optimization with various image types. Validate database and storage updates after edits. Test alignment options and their rendering.
